Usually the default class id Spring gives to a class is the name of the class with the first letter in lowercase

So for example:

Student becomes student
NoMoreMisterNiceGuy becomes noMoreMisterNiceGuy
X becomes x

BUT

URL stays URL
XML stays URL
TObaco stays TObaco 

The idea is that the first two letters are uppercase the id is exactly as the name of the class
